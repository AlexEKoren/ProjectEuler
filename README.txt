These are solutions (and a lot attempts at solutions) to problems posted on ProjectEuler.net.

Some of these solutions date back to 2010 where I was teaching myself Python as I was solving and the most recent are from the spring of 2013.

I'm currently in the top .5% of all solvers worldwide and while I don't solve much anymore, I do go back occasionally and have a look around at the new problems as well as solutions posted on the forums.

Let me know if you have any questions about my solutions or how they work!
